# IBB-Ear-Detection
This is the repository for my IBB ear detection assignment. Here you will find a set of scripts which can detect left and right ears in a given image.

About the scripts: 
usesa.py is the script which detects ears through a webcam.
usesa2.py is the script which detects ears through pictures from the AWE database.
boundingbox.m is the script which evaluates the boundingbox overlap.

What you will need to run every script:
Python with the opencv library and Matlab with the computer vision toolbox.
